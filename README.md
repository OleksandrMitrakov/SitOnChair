SitOnChair

First Project at the IT fullstack bootcamp.

An example of one page landing website for furniture-orientated company, based on a graphic project.

Website provides an animated menu, a slider, which is responsive to 'manual' toggling by user. It includes a 'calculator' section, which calculates the price of chair, based on client's choices (such as: fabric, color etc.)

Technologies I used:

-HTML 5
-Sass
-vanilla JS
